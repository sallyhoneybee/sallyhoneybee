### Hello there, Summer here :lotus_position_woman:
Never would I have thought to fall in love with codes. But here I am after a great run with Le Wagon's 9 week intensive bootcamp. Right now, I just want to keep building and building.... and building. Call me Bob the Builder. Always  excited to connect and communicate with new people so do drop me a bzzt bzzt! <br>

## Currently on my #100DaysOfCode 👩🏻‍💻
You can keep track of my progress on [Threads]([https://www.instagram.com/thefatdog/](https://www.threads.net/@thefatdog)) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sallyhoneybee),  and even join me on this journey as I tackle Data Structures and Algorithms, React.js in all its glory, Next.js, Typescript and hopefully Three.js. Yes, it is very Javascript heavy! I also do have a side quest to cover the basics of Traditional Chinese Medicine during these 100 days ☯ and hopefully strengthen my knowledge in chinese herbalogy 🫚🌿.
